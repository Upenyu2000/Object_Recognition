Task: Object Recognition Readme

Objective:
The task at hand revolves around object recognition, a fundamental problem in machine learning and computer vision. With the exponential growth of image data, there's a pressing need to develop robust algorithms capable of identifying objects within images. This task serves as an entry point into exploring this complex problem within the realm of machine learning.

Dataset Description:
You'll be provided with a small image dataset containing 100 different categories of objects. Each category comprises 500 training images and 100 testing images. Each image features only one object, simplifying the classification task. The goal is to utilize machine learning algorithms to accurately classify testing images into their respective object categories.

Resources Provided:
Code snippets for computing image features and visualizing images are available. These resources can aid in understanding the dataset and extracting relevant features for machine learning algorithms. While the provided code is beneficial, participants are not obligated to use all of it. Additionally, participants can incorporate established Python packages like sklearn, skimage, keras, and scipy to streamline the process.

Approach:
Participants are encouraged to adopt a scientific approach, leveraging methodologies from established Python packages discussed in lab sheets. You have the flexibility to explore and implement various machine learning algorithms for classification. It's essential to conduct a thorough comparison between at least two methods to gauge their effectiveness in solving the object recognition problem.
